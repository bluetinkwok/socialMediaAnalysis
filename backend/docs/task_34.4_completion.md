# Task 34.4 Completion: HTTPS Enforcement and Trusted Host Middleware

## Implementation Summary

The HTTPS enforcement and trusted host middleware have been successfully implemented with the following components:

1. **Security Headers Middleware**: Added a custom middleware to apply security headers to all responses
2. **HTTPS Enforcement**: Implemented using FastAPI's HTTPSRedirectMiddleware
3. **Trusted Host Validation**: Implemented using FastAPI's TrustedHostMiddleware
4. **Configuration Settings**: Added trusted_hosts setting to the application configuration
5. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation for deployment and testing

## Files Modified/Created

- `backend/core/security_headers.py`: Created middleware for security headers, HTTPS enforcement, and trusted host validation
- `backend/core/config.py`: Added trusted_hosts setting
- `backend/main.py`: Already configured to use the security middleware
- `backend/example.env`: Added TRUSTED_HOSTS configuration example
- `backend/docs/https_enforcement.md`: Documentation for the middleware
- `backend/docs/https_deployment_guide.md`: Guide for deploying with HTTPS
- `backend/tests/test_security_headers.py`: Unit tests for the security middleware
- `backend/scripts/test_https_enforcement.py`: Script to test HTTPS enforcement and trusted host validation

## Testing

The implementation has been tested with:

1. **Unit Tests**: Created tests for the security headers middleware
2. **Manual Testing**: Verified that security headers are applied correctly
3. **Test Script**: Created a script to test HTTPS enforcement and trusted host validation

## Security Considerations

- HTTPS enforcement is only enabled in production mode (when DEBUG=False)
- Trusted host validation is only enabled in production mode
- Security headers are always applied, even in debug mode
- The application can be configured to use different trusted hosts in different environments

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the application with HTTPS using the provided deployment guide
2. Configure the trusted hosts in the production environment
3. Run the test script to verify that HTTPS enforcement and trusted host validation are working correctly
4. Consider implementing additional security measures like HSTS preloading
