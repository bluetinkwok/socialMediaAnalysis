# Success Pattern Recognition Rules

## Overview
This document defines the rule-based success patterns to be recognized by the analytics engine. These patterns identify combinations of content attributes and performance metrics that correlate with successful posts.

## Rule Categories

### 1. Engagement-Based Patterns

#### 1.1 High Engagement Rate
- **Definition**: Posts with engagement rates significantly higher than platform averages
- **Rule**: `engagement_rate > platform_threshold['high_engagement_rate']`
- **Implementation**: Already implemented in `_identify_success_patterns()` method
- **Data Required**: Engagement rate, platform-specific thresholds

#### 1.2 Viral Potential
- **Definition**: Posts with high share-to-view ratios indicating viral potential
- **Rule**: `share_rate > 0.01` (1% of viewers share the content)
- **Implementation**: Already implemented in `_identify_success_patterns()` method
- **Data Required**: Shares count, views count

#### 1.3 High Content Value
- **Definition**: Posts with high save-to-view ratios indicating valuable content
- **Rule**: `save_rate > 0.005` (0.5% of viewers save the content)
- **Implementation**: Already implemented in `_identify_success_patterns()` method
- **Data Required**: Saves count, views count

#### 1.4 Strong Community Engagement
- **Definition**: Posts with high comment-to-view ratios indicating discussion-worthy content
- **Rule**: `comment_rate > 0.01` (1% of viewers comment on the content)
- **Implementation**: Already implemented in `_identify_success_patterns()` method
- **Data Required**: Comments count, views count

### 2. Content Type Patterns

#### 2.1 Successful Video Content
- **Definition**: Video posts with high performance scores
- **Rule**: `content_type == ContentType.VIDEO && performance_score >= 75`
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Content type, performance score

#### 2.2 Successful Image Content
- **Definition**: Image posts with high engagement rates
- **Rule**: `content_type == ContentType.IMAGE && engagement_rate > platform_threshold['high_engagement_rate'] * 1.2`
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Content type, engagement rate, platform thresholds

#### 2.3 Successful Text Content
- **Definition**: Text-only posts with high interaction depth
- **Rule**: `content_type == ContentType.TEXT && interaction_depth_score > 70`
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Content type, interaction depth score

### 3. Temporal Patterns

#### 3.1 Optimal Posting Time
- **Definition**: Posts published during hours with consistently high engagement
- **Rule**: Post time falls within platform's top 3 performing hours
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Post publish time, historical performance by hour

#### 3.2 Weekend Success
- **Definition**: Posts performing well on weekends
- **Rule**: `is_weekend == True && performance_score > avg_weekend_score * 1.2`
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Post publish day, performance score, average weekend performance

#### 3.3 Rapid Growth
- **Definition**: Posts showing unusually rapid engagement growth in first hours
- **Rule**: `engagement_velocity > avg_velocity * 2`
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Engagement velocity, average velocity for similar content

### 4. Content Feature Patterns

#### 4.1 Hashtag Effectiveness
- **Definition**: Posts with specific hashtags that consistently outperform
- **Rule**: Post contains hashtags that have average performance > platform average
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Post hashtags, hashtag performance history

#### 4.2 Optimal Content Length
- **Definition**: Posts with content length in the optimal range for their platform/type
- **Rule**: Content length falls within optimal range for platform and content type
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Content length (duration for videos, character count for text, etc.)

#### 4.3 Mention Success
- **Definition**: Posts that mention other accounts and receive higher engagement
- **Rule**: `mentions.length > 0 && engagement_rate > no_mention_avg_rate * 1.15`
- **Implementation**: To be implemented
- **Data Required**: Post mentions, engagement rate, average engagement rate for posts without mentions

## Implementation Notes

1. **Rule Evaluation**: Each rule should be evaluated independently and can be combined to identify multi-factor patterns.

2. **Pattern Storage**: Detected patterns should be stored in the `success_patterns` field of the `AnalyticsData` model.

3. **Confidence Levels**: Each detected pattern should include a confidence level based on data quality and sample size.

4. **Pattern Format**: Patterns should be stored in a consistent format:
   ```json
   {
     "pattern_name": {
       "detected": true,
       "confidence": 0.85,
       "metrics": {
         "relevant_metric_1": value,
         "relevant_metric_2": value
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Pattern Aggregation**: The `TrendDetector` can aggregate patterns across multiple posts to identify trending patterns.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the additional pattern rules defined in this document
2. Create unit tests to verify pattern detection accuracy
3. Integrate pattern detection with the analytics engine
4. Develop visualization components for identified patterns
