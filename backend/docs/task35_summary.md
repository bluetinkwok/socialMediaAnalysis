# Task 35: Data Encryption and Privacy Controls - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 35: Data Encryption and Privacy Controls.

## Subtasks Implemented

### 1. Implement Secure Key Management and Rotation

- Created a robust key management system in `core/encryption.py`
- Implemented automatic key generation with strong cryptographic keys
- Added key rotation functionality with configurable rotation periods (default: 90 days)
- Implemented secure key storage with proper file permissions
- Added support for multiple keys to allow decryption of data encrypted with older keys

### 2. Implement Database Field Encryption

- Created encrypted field types in `db/encrypted_fields.py` using SQLAlchemy-Utils
- Implemented custom encryption engine using our key management system
- Added support for different types of encrypted fields:
  - `EncryptedString`: For sensitive text data
  - `EncryptedJSON`: For sensitive JSON data
  - `EncryptedBinary`: For sensitive binary data
- Added helper functions to easily create encrypted columns

### 3. Implement File Encryption for Stored Media

- Created a file encryption system in `core/file_encryption.py`
- Implemented AES-256-CBC encryption for files
- Added per-file unique encryption keys for enhanced security
- Implemented metadata storage for encrypted files
- Added integrity verification during decryption
- Implemented streaming encryption/decryption for large files

### 4. Implement Data Retention Policies

- Created a data retention system in `core/data_retention.py`
- Implemented configurable retention periods for different types of data
- Added functions to apply retention policies to database records
- Added functions to delete expired files
- Implemented data anonymization for expired user data

### 5. Implement GDPR/CCPA Compliance Features

- Created privacy compliance features in `core/privacy_compliance.py`
- Implemented consent management for different purposes
- Added support for data subject rights (access, deletion, etc.)
- Created models for privacy-related database tables in `db/privacy_models.py`
- Added data processing activity logging
- Implemented user privacy settings
- Updated the User model with privacy-related fields

## Database Changes

- Added new tables:
  - `user_consents`: For tracking user consent
  - `data_subject_requests`: For tracking data subject requests
  - `data_processing_logs`: For logging data processing activities
  - `data_breach_logs`: For logging data breaches
  - `privacy_settings`: For user privacy preferences
  - `data_retention_policies`: For configurable retention policies

- Added new columns to the `users` table:
  - `anonymized`: Whether the user has been anonymized
  - `anonymized_at`: When the user was anonymized
  - `data_export_requested_at`: When the user requested data export
  - `data_export_completed_at`: When the data export was completed
  - `deletion_requested_at`: When the user requested deletion
  - `processing_restricted`: Whether processing is restricted
  - `processing_restricted_at`: When processing was restricted

## Scripts and Utilities

- Created migration script in `migrations/add_encryption_and_privacy.py`
- Added script to run migrations in `scripts/run_migrations.py`
- Created script to initialize the encryption system in `scripts/initialize_encryption.py`
- Added tests for encryption features in `tests/test_encryption.py`

## Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/encryption_privacy.md`
- Added examples of using the encryption and privacy features

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- Encryption keys are securely stored with proper permissions
- Keys are automatically rotated to limit the impact of key compromise
- Personal data is subject to retention policies
- User consent is tracked for different purposes
- Data subject rights are supported through appropriate APIs

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for field-level encryption in the API responses
- Implement encrypted backups
- Add support for hardware security modules (HSMs) for key storage
- Enhance the consent management system with more granular controls
- Add more comprehensive audit logging for privacy-related operations
