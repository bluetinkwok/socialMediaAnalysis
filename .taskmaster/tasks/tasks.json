Incorporate proxy support with IP rotation to distribute requests across multiple IP addresses, reducing the risk of IP bans. Implement request throttling with randomized delays and exponential backoff strategies to mimic human browsing behavior and avoid triggering rate limits. Manage sessions and cookies effectively to maintain stateful interactions with target websites. Develop captcha detection mechanisms that can identify when a captcha challenge is presented and either pause scraping or trigger appropriate solving workflows.

Simulate high-frequency requests and verify that request throttling delays are applied and exponential backoff triggers on failures.
