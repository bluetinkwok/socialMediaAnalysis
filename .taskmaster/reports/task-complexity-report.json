			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Basic Success Pattern Recognition (Rule-Based)",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task 'Implement Basic Success Pattern Recognition (Rule-Based)' into 5 subtasks covering rule definition, implementation within the Analytics Engine and database interaction, and testing.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves extending an existing component, defining and implementing logic based on rules, interacting with the database, and implementing a test strategy. While the rules are simple, the integration and testing aspects contribute to a medium complexity."

		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Setup Project Repository and Initial Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the repository initialization, CI/CD pipeline setup, dependency configuration, and environment variable management into detailed subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves multiple distinct technical steps including repository setup, CI/CD configuration, and environment management, each requiring careful configuration but generally following standard procedures."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Database Schema for CV Results",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose the schema design, migration implementation, and indexing/query optimization into separate subtasks.",
			"reasoning": "Designing an efficient schema for large volumes of CV data with indexing and migration requires thoughtful planning and testing, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Image Analysis Capabilities",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for each analysis feature: object detection, scene classification, face detection, text detection, color analysis, image quality assessment, and composition analysis.",
			"reasoning": "This task covers multiple advanced CV features using deep learning and integration, each with unique challenges and testing requirements, resulting in high complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate CV Analysis with Analytics Engine",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for merging CV and NLP data, implementing unified scoring, and ensuring data flow consistency.",
			"reasoning": "Integration of heterogeneous data sources and unified scoring logic involves complex data handling and validation but is more focused than core feature development."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Video Analysis Capabilities",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail subtasks for keyframe extraction, scene change detection, motion analysis, content summarization, thumbnail quality assessment, and engagement point identification.",
			"reasoning": "Video analysis adds temporal complexity and multiple specialized features, requiring significant development and testing effort."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Cross-Modal Analysis Features",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for text-image correlation, audio-visual synchronization, caption relevance scoring, and hashtag-image relevance analysis.",
			"reasoning": "Cross-modal analysis involves complex algorithm development across different data types and integration with existing pipelines, increasing complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Build Content Moderation and Brand Safety",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Separate into subtasks for inappropriate content detection, brand safety detection (logos/products), and model integration/testing.",
			"reasoning": "Content moderation requires sensitive detection models and accuracy validation, but leverages pre-trained models which reduces complexity somewhat."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Trend Detection and Style Transfer Analysis",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide into subtasks for trend identification, popularity tracking, and style transfer analysis with recommendations.",
			"reasoning": "Trend detection and style transfer involve advanced deep learning models and temporal data analysis, moderately complex but focused."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Enhance API and Frontend for Visual Insights",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for API endpoint development, frontend visualization enhancements, success pattern visualization, and processing status tracking.",
			"reasoning": "Extending API and frontend requires coordination between backend and UI, with moderate complexity in data visualization and interaction design."
