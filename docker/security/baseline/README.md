# Docker Security Baseline

This directory contains security baseline information for Docker containers in the Social Media Analysis platform. These files are generated by the `generate-baseline.sh` script and serve as a reference point for security auditing and compliance checks.

## Baseline Files

- **docker-info.txt**: General Docker information
- **docker-version.txt**: Docker version details
- **system-info.txt**: Host system information
- **docker-networks.txt**: Docker network configuration
- **docker-security.txt**: Docker security options
- **daemon.json**: Docker daemon configuration
- **container-security.txt**: Security details of running containers

## Usage

These baseline files should be generated in a known-good state of your environment. They can then be used for:

1. **Security Auditing**: Compare current state against the baseline to detect changes
2. **Compliance Checks**: Verify that security settings match requirements
3. **Incident Response**: Determine if security settings have been altered during an incident
4. **Documentation**: Provide a record of the security configuration

## Generating a New Baseline

To generate a new security baseline:

```bash
cd docker
./security/generate-baseline.sh
```

## Comparing Against Baseline

To compare the current environment against the baseline:

```bash
# Generate a temporary current state
mkdir -p /tmp/docker-current
docker info > /tmp/docker-current/docker-info.txt
docker version > /tmp/docker-current/docker-version.txt

# Compare with baseline
diff -r security/baseline /tmp/docker-current
```

## Security Recommendations

Always ensure that:

1. Containers run as non-root users
2. Production containers use read-only filesystems
3. Only necessary capabilities are added
4. Unnecessary capabilities are dropped
5. Seccomp and AppArmor profiles are applied
6. Resource limits are set appropriately
7. Network isolation is properly configured
