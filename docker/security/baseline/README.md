# Security Baselines

This directory stores security baseline files generated by the `generate-baseline.sh` script.

## What are Security Baselines?

Security baselines are snapshots of the security configuration and state of your containers at a specific point in time. They serve as a reference point for detecting changes or anomalies in your container security posture.

## Baseline Contents

Each baseline file contains information about:

- Container configuration (user, capabilities, mounts)
- Network settings
- Resource limits
- Running processes
- Open ports
- Installed packages
- Security options (seccomp, apparmor)

## Usage

1. **Generate a baseline**:
   ```
   ../generate-baseline.sh
   ```

2. **Compare current state with baseline**:
   ```
   diff <(../generate-baseline.sh --output=temp) <baseline_file>
   ```

3. **Update baseline after authorized changes**:
   ```
   ../generate-baseline.sh --update
   ```

## Best Practices

- Generate a new baseline after each significant configuration change
- Store baselines in version control
- Review baselines as part of security audits
- Automate baseline comparison in CI/CD pipelines
