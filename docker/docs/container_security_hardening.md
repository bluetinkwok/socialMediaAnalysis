# Docker Container Security Hardening

This document outlines the security measures implemented in our Docker container setup for the Social Media Analysis Platform.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Container Image Security
- **Multi-stage builds**: Separate build and runtime environments to minimize attack surface
- **Minimal base images**: Using slim variants of official images
- **Non-root users**: All containers run as non-root users with least privilege
- **Image scanning**: Regular vulnerability scanning of container images
- **No unnecessary packages**: Only essential packages are installed

### 2. Network Security
- **Network isolation**: Separate networks for frontend, backend, and database services
- **Limited exposed ports**: Only necessary ports are exposed
- **Internal communication**: Services communicate through Docker networks, not exposed ports
- **TLS encryption**: All external communications are encrypted

### 3. Security Profiles and Restrictions
- **Seccomp profiles**: Restricting system calls to minimize kernel attack surface
- **AppArmor profiles**: Process isolation and access control
- **Dropped capabilities**: Removing unnecessary Linux capabilities
- **Read-only filesystems**: Production containers use read-only filesystems where possible
- **No privileged mode**: Containers do not run in privileged mode

### 4. Resource Controls
- **CPU limits**: Preventing CPU exhaustion attacks
- **Memory limits**: Preventing memory-based DoS attacks
- **Ulimit settings**: Controlling file descriptors and processes
- **Restart policies**: Automatic recovery from failures

### 5. Secrets Management
- **Docker secrets**: Sensitive information stored as Docker secrets
- **Environment separation**: Different configurations for development and production
- **No hardcoded secrets**: No credentials in Dockerfiles or images

### 6. Health and Monitoring
- **Container healthchecks**: Regular verification of container health
- **Security baseline**: Generated security baseline for auditing
- **Security scanning**: Regular scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Audit logging**: Logging of security-relevant events

## Security Best Practices

### For Development
1. Always use the latest security patches
2. Do not use privileged containers for development
3. Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly
4. Do not disable security features for convenience

### For Production
1. Enable all security features in production
2. Use read-only filesystems where possible
3. Monitor container resource usage
4. Implement proper logging and monitoring
5. Use secrets management for all credentials
6. Regularly update base images and dependencies

## Security Tools

### Docker Security Check
Run the security check script to verify your Docker configuration:
```bash
./docker/security/docker-security-check.sh
```

### Generate Security Baseline
Generate a security baseline for auditing:
```bash
./docker/security/generate-baseline.sh
```

### Load AppArmor Profiles
Load the AppArmor profiles for enhanced container isolation:
```bash
./docker/security/load-apparmor.sh
```
