# Task 37: Security Logging and Monitoring - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of Task 37: Security Logging and Monitoring for the Social Media Analysis Platform. The task focused on implementing comprehensive security event logging, real-time monitoring, intrusion detection, and audit trails to enhance the security posture of the application.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Security Logging System

- **Structured Logging**: Implemented a structured logging system using `structlog` and `python-json-logger` in `core/security_logger.py`.
- **Security-Specific Log Levels**: Created custom log levels for different security severities (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW, INFO, DEBUG).
- **Contextual Information**: Ensured all logs include relevant context such as user IDs, IP addresses, timestamps, and resource identifiers.
- **Specialized Log Methods**: Added convenience methods for common security events like authentication failures, permission denials, and suspicious activities.

### 2. Security Metrics Collection

- **Prometheus Integration**: Implemented metrics collection using `prometheus-client` in `models/security.py`.
- **Authentication Metrics**: Added metrics for tracking authentication success/failure rates and latency.
- **Access Control Metrics**: Added metrics for tracking access denied events and permission check latency.
- **Rate Limiting Metrics**: Added metrics for tracking rate limit exceeded events and current usage.
- **Suspicious Activity Metrics**: Added metrics for tracking suspicious activities by type and severity.
- **File Security Metrics**: Added metrics for tracking file scanning operations and rejections.
- **Session Metrics**: Added metrics for tracking active sessions and session expirations.

### 3. Intrusion Detection System

- **Pattern Detection**: Implemented an intrusion detection system in `core/intrusion_detection.py` to identify potential security threats.
- **Brute Force Detection**: Added detection for multiple failed login attempts.
- **Unusual Login Detection**: Added detection for logins at unusual times or from unusual locations.
- **Excessive Requests Detection**: Added detection for potential DoS attacks or scraping.
- **Unusual Data Access**: Added detection for potential data exfiltration.
- **Unusual File Uploads**: Added detection for potentially malicious file uploads.
- **Potential Injection Attacks**: Added detection for SQL injection, command injection, and XSS attempts.
- **Suspicious Entity Tracking**: Implemented tracking of suspicious IP addresses and users.

### 4. Comprehensive Audit Trails

- **Database Models**: Created database models for audit records in `db/audit_models.py`.
- **Audit Service**: Implemented an audit trail service in `core/audit_trail.py` for tracking security-relevant actions.
- **Change Tracking**: Added tracking of specific changes made to resources, including old and new values.
- **Sensitive Data Handling**: Added automatic identification and protection of sensitive fields.
- **Query Capabilities**: Implemented flexible querying by user, action type, resource type, and time range.
- **Export Capabilities**: Added export functionality for compliance reporting.

### 5. Security Monitoring and Alerting

- **Security Middleware**: Implemented middleware for security logging and metrics collection in `core/security_middleware.py`.
- **Security Monitoring API**: Created API endpoints for security monitoring in `api/v1/security_monitoring.py`.
- **Audit API**: Created API endpoints for accessing audit trails in `api/v1/audit.py`.
- **Metrics API**: Created API endpoints for exposing Prometheus metrics in `api/v1/metrics.py`.
- **Grafana Dashboard**: Created a Grafana dashboard for security monitoring in `monitoring/grafana/security_dashboard.json`.

### 6. Security Baselines and Compliance

- **Baseline Generator**: Implemented a security baseline generator in `backend/scripts/generate_security_baseline.py`.
- **Baseline Comparison**: Added functionality to compare security baselines to detect changes.
- **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation in `docs/security_logging_monitoring.md`.
